# three-globe

## Little Test project in Three.js library environment
 This project, is a little test to improve my skills on this library. It's just the World rotating on the y axis by default but when moving the mouse,
 an eventListener can get the mouse coordinate and move the globe using the GSAP library.
 
## npm used
 In this project npm version: 8.19.2 is used.

## builded by parcel library
 In the very start I've installed the parcel library and customized the script to build the project itself.
 
## code commented
 All the code is easy to read, thanks to all the comments writed within the code itself
 
## Credits to Chris_Courses
 For this project i've taken inspiration from Chris_Courses course on YouTube.
